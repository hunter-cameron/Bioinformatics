Bioinformatics
==============

A collection of scripts I wrote (am writing) that are tailored to the bioinformatic tasks I need to do while working for the Dangl lab at UNC-Chapel Hill.

==============

This repository is essentially my working directory of scripts. Some scripts may not work, and others may have bugs, and still others may never work and exist only as learning points to help me recall what was unsuccessful in the past. 

I'll try to keep documentation on the scripts (mostly as comments in the code and usage statements) as up to date as possible, but the documentation will not be all-inclusive because the scripts in this directory are intended primarily for my own use, and, in general, have not been written with other users in mind.

Therefore, FEEL FREE TO USE/MODIFY ANYTHING YOU FIND HERE BUT DO SO AT ENTIRELY YOUR OWN RISK! See the LICENSE for more on this. Even better, feel free to edit/improve upon anything you see here! I am always open to design and feature suggestions and would love to work on any of it with anyone who finds something that I've written interesting or useful. :-)

The directory: "scripts_for_others" contains scripts that have been tested and documented a little more throughly and have the potential to be useful for others as the directory name implies. Basically, this directory contains links to the scripts wherever they reside in this repository. I chose to do this rather than make another repository because I want to keep all the scripts together instead of having "production" grade scripts and "just-for-me" scripts in separate repositories. This is great for me as a developer but not-so-great for people who want to close only my useful scripts. This is because it is required to clone the entire repository to get at the scripts that are useful for others. Currently, the repository is not very big so I do not think this is a problem, but as the library grows, I may reconsider.

NOTE: Just as a final disclaimer to those working over ssh connection, almost all of these scripts were written using vim so I did not follow the 79 character line length guidelines specified in PEP because I didn't want to have to manually wrap lines and then worry about adjusting line breaks if I needed to edit the code.
