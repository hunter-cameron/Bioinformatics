Bioinformatics
==============

A collection of scripts I wrote (am writing) that are tailored to the bioinformatic tasks I needed to do while working for the Dangl lab at UNC-Chapel Hill.

==============

This repository is essentially my working directory of scripts. Some scripts may not work and others may have bugs and still others may never work and exist only as learning points to help me recall what was unsuccessful in the past. 

I'll try to keep documentation on the scripts (mostly as comments in the code and usage statements) as up to date as possible but the documentation will not be all-inclusive because the scripts in this directory are intended primarily for my own use and, in general, have not been written with other users in mind.

Therefore, FEEL FREE TO USE/MODIFY ANYTHING YOU FIND HERE BUT DO SO AT ENTIRELY YOUR OWN RISK! See the LICENSE for more on this. Even better, feel free to edit/improve upon anything you see here! I am always open to design and feature suggestions and would love to work on any of it with anyone who finds something that I've written interesting or useful. :-)

As time goes on, I will make an attempt to set aside what I consider to be the scripts that are most useful to a wider audience and provide sufficient documentation/error checking to enable others to use these scripts.

NOTE: Almost all of these scripts were written using vim so I did not follow the 80 character line length guidelines because I didn't want to have to manually wrap lines and then worry about adjusting line breaks if I needed to edit the code.
