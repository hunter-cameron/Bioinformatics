This directory contains scripts that are intended for more general usage.

As the README in the root directory states, use these scripts at entirely
your own risk!!! I hope they will be useful but they should all be considered
beta versions. I have not extensively error checked any of them though I will 
be more than happy to deal with any bugs/errors that are brought to my 
attention.


Current Scripts in this Directory:

compare_two_lists.py        Simple utility to compare the content of two lists.
                            Reports items that on both lists and unique to
                            either list.

extract_16S_from_barrnap_gff.py

                            Extracts 16S sequences from a barrnap-created
                            *.gff file.

jgi_interface.py            Script to log in and download files from the JGI
                            or IMG websites. For documentation, run using the
                            '-h' option.

mypyli                      MY PYthon LIbrary. Custom library of python
                            modules that can be imported into your scripts.
                            These are all experimental but I have found the
                            most useful to be taxtree.py which does operations
                            with taxonomy strings (k_Bacteria; p_...) including
                            looking them up from taxonomy ids, trimming them,
                            and performing simple "is-a-member-of" functions.
                            Within taxtree.py, converting taxids to taxonomy
                            strings is fairly well tested (though not error
                            proof) but other functions aren't as well tested.

prune_phylo_tree.py         Script to prune a phylogenetic tree based on a list
                            of node names or a regular expression. Also supports
                            changing node names. Run using '-h' for complete docs. 

run_checkm.py               Runs the genome assembly checking program "CheckM".
                            This program is intended to run CheckM at a specific 
                            taxonomic level and also easily support adding new
                            genomes to CheckM analyses without rerunning the whole
                            set. 
             
                            ** CheckM has been updated since this script was written,
                               this script may no longer work properly.
