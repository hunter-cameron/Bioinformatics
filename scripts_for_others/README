This directory contains scripts that are intended for more general usage.

As the README in the root directory states, use these scripts at entirely
your own risk!!! I hope they will be useful but they should all be considered
beta versions. I have not extensively error checked any of them though I will 
be more than happy to deal with any bugs/errors that are brought to my 
attention.


Current Scripts in this Directory:

download_from_JGI.py        Script to log in and download files from the JGI
                            or IMG websites. For documentation, run using the
                            '-h' option.

mypyli                      MY PYthon LIbrary. Custom library of python
                            modules that can be imported into your scripts.
                            These are all experimental but I have found the
                            most useful to be taxtree.py which does operations
                            with taxonomy strings (k_Bacteria; p_...) including
                            looking them up from taxonomy ids, trimming them,
                            and performing simple "is-a-member-of" functions.
                            Within taxtree.py, converting taxids to taxonomy
                            strings is fairly well tested (though not error
                            proof) but other functions aren't as well tested.
