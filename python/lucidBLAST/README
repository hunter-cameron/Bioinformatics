A small (relatively untested) software package for displaying the
results of a BLAST search (XML format) as a series of alignments
to a reference genome.

Works best when the number of references are small.

Intended to be used to find duplications and misassemblies in contigs: 
BLAST the contig by itself and load it into lucidBLAST and anywhere with
coverage that that stacks (2 or more lines over the reference) is a 
duplicated region. 


I am not intending to add new features to this software package but I do
intend to clean up and document what is already here because I think it
may be of use to the lab after I leave.

With that said, I haven't worked on this project since I began learning
Python but I do remember enjoying working on it then so I may end up
adding just some small features as I see fit :-). Or, at least, I could
be easily convinced to add something to this package if "need" arises.

This project is currently only one I've written using an IDE (PyCharm) 
so any quirks in the code that look like they were written by a machine 
might actually have been!


Usage Tips:

Entry point is through BLAST_parser.py

In display mode, references can be changes by clicking on another reference
from the left of the screen and dragging it to the plot you want it to be 
displayed in.

Click on the lines to display more information about them in the information 
pannel. 

NOTE:
Due to display resolution, sometimes it looks like alignments overlap when
they actually do not. Also, it looks like some alignments are huge when
actually there are just a series of small nearby alignments. This is an
artifact of displaying kilo or megabases of sequence using a screen 
resolution that is only several thousand pixels at most. I.E. hundreds 
or thousands of bases will be represented by a single pixel.
