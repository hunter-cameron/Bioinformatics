This is the README for my perl scripts directory.

Scripts that have "??" in the description may or may not (probably do not) work but are kept because I don't remember their full purpose or as coding examples for future use.



add_length_to_header.pl - from a FASTA file adds the length of all sequences to their headers
==========================================================
automated_functional_analysis.pl - ?? concept script to look up genes in esearch
==========================================================
bin_blast.pl - ?? Perl version of parallel BLAST with command substitution
==========================================================
bioperl_genbank_parse.pl - basically just a scaffold of how to use BioPerl to parse a GenBank file
==========================================================
blast_alignment_stats.pl - ?? gets some useful stats from a blast search like how many targets it hits, etc.
==========================================================
chromosome_reversal_forked.pl - ?? script used to detect plasmid by blasting contigs against database, things with good hits are chromosomal
==========================================================
coverage_pipeline.pl - generates the datafile for the genome coverage database
==========================================================
Directory_obj.pm - a module for working with directories used by some of the other scripts
==========================================================
driver_coverage_pipeline.pl - ?? Not sure how this is different from coverage_pipeline.pl but I don't want to delete it in case
==========================================================
genabank_get_hypothetical_seqs.pl - makes a FASTA file of sequences that annotated as hypothetical in a GenBank
==========================================================
get_coverage_per_gene.pl - ?? like coverage_pipeline.pl but for genes
==========================================================
mummer_dotplot_from_fasta.pl - makes dotplots of FASTA files (pairwise)
==========================================================
parallel_blast.pm - module to substitute BLAST command and run on multiple nodes
==========================================================
parallelize_blast.pm - module to substitute BLAST command and run on multiple forks using the fork() function
==========================================================
plasgraph/ - directory containing an early suite of scripts I wrote to look for plasmids
==========================================================
PlasmidFinder/ - directory containing another novice suite of scripts to look for plasmids
==========================================================
plasmid_finder.pl - ?? script to use a variety of metrics to try to identify plasmids
==========================================================
plot_coverage.pl - ?? not really sure what this is or if it works but it looks like a good bit of work went into it so I don't want to delete it
==========================================================
retrieve_raw_reads.pl - ?? precursor to the python download JGI script, keeping it because this has thread options (that didn't work but might be fixable)
==========================================================
SequenceMapper/ - messy directory of perl objects for whatever SequenceMapper was. Contains several examples of OO perl development
==========================================================
uninstall_module.pl - script to uninstall a module that I found on a website somewhere
==========================================================
write_random_contigs.pl - was a one-off script to break a FASTA up into a subset of contigs but could be tweaked to be more usable
==========================================================
