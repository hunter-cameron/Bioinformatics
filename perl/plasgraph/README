This is one of the first projects I worked on so I don't remember much about it.

It basically takes a source directory of fasta files and ran cBar on every fasta
in the directory and dumped the results to an output directory along with a graph
of the sequences classified as plasmids and their links.

The fastX... script is from Scott Yourstone.

plasgraph+.pl is the script to run. The others are previous versions of it.
