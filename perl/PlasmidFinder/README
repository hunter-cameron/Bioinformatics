This was an early project used to help search for plasmids in the
contigs of a draft genome assembly. 

I don't remember anything about it besides that.

Also has some scripts (and prototypes of scripts) that were helpful for
turning the results into a format that I could insert into a MySQL database.

Small example of doing object oriented programming in perl using 
Damian Conway's inside-out objects.


I believe the dump_all_stats.pl might be the most recent entry point.
